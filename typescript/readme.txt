TypeScript:
- Declare variable type
- Compiling to JavaScript
- Static typing Any variable, function argument or return value can have its type defined on initialization
- Interfaces are used to type-check whether an object fits a certain structure. 
By defining an interface we can name a specific combination of variables,
making sure that they will always go together. 
When translated to JavaScript, interfaces disappear - their only purpose is to help in the development stage.
- TypeScript Classes + OOP
- Generics are templates that allow the same function to accept arguments of various different types.
- Modules
